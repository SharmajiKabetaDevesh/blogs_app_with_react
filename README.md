This app involves a mixture of everything i learned which are react redux, routing ,slug creation etc
It was not that easy that one can build in a day ,this is basically an effort of about 3 weeks debugging and error handling.

One major think I learned a new way of debugging :
console.log("Appwrite service :: deletePost :: error", error)
this makes it simple to understand where to look for this is the file name "Appwrite" ,the second is the function "deletePost" and then the error;
